JOB FIT SCORING - TEST ROUND 3
==============================
Generated: 2025-12-21T20:45:15.317Z

These 4 resumes are designed to stress-test specific failure modes
identified in prior testing rounds.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RESUME 1: TITLE INFLATION DETECTOR
File: test_resume_1_title_inflation_derek_simmons.docx
Candidate: Derek Simmons
Current Title: "Head of Product"
Actual Level: PM I/II (feature-level work)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Should detect title inflation (senior title, junior scope)
- No team size mentioned
- No budget/P&L ownership
- No multi-product roadmap evidence
- Companies are unverifiable (seed-stage, defunct, agency)
- EXPECTED SCORE CAP: 55% max for Senior PM roles
- EXPECTED RECOMMENDATION: "Apply with Caution" or "Long Shot"

RED FLAGS TO DETECT:
✓ "Head of Product" at 5-person startup
✓ "Work with 3-person engineering team" (not leading)
✓ Company "now defunct" - no verification possible
✓ No metrics showing business impact
✓ Language shows execution, not strategy

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RESUME 2: CAREER SWITCHER DETECTION
File: test_resume_2_career_switcher_priya_venkatesh.docx
Candidate: Priya Venkatesh
Current Title: "Senior Technical Program Manager"
Seeking: Product Manager role

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Should detect career switcher pattern
- Should flag "PM-adjacent" language
- EXPECTED SCORE CAP: 40% for PM roles
- EXPECTED RECOMMENDATION: "Do Not Apply" with coaching

LANGUAGE PATTERNS TO DETECT:
✓ "Partner with PM team" (supporting, not owning)
✓ "Contributed to product strategy" (input, not decision)
✓ "Supported product launches" (execution, not strategy)
✓ "Collaborated with Product Managers" (coordination role)
✓ "Coordinated... for product team" (service function)
✓ "Seeking to transition into a Product Manager role" (explicit)

COACHING EXPECTED:
"Your background is Program Management, not Product Management.
Your resume shows adjacent exposure, not direct product ownership.
Target Associate PM roles to build direct ownership experience."

RESUME 3: FUNCTION MISMATCH (Calculator Selection)
File: test_resume_3_function_mismatch_kendra_williams.docx
Candidate: Kendra Williams
Current Title: "Director of Talent Acquisition"
Function: Recruiting/TA

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- When applying to recruiting roles: Should recognize 10+ years
- Should NOT use PM calculator (would return 0 years)
- Should use recruiting-specific calculator
- EXPECTED SCORE: 70-85% for Director TA roles
- EXPECTED RECOMMENDATION: "Apply" or "Strong Apply"

THIS TESTS:
✓ Function detection (is this a PM role or recruiting role?)
✓ Calculator routing (use TA calculator, not PM calculator)
✓ Experience recognition (10 years recruiting should count)

BUG WE'RE TESTING FOR:
Previous bug: Jordan's 12-year recruiting career returned 0 years
because the PM calculator was used instead of recruiting calculator.

RESUME 4: COMPANY CREDIBILITY SCORING
File: test_resume_4_credibility_test_marcus_chen_ramirez.docx
Candidate: Marcus Chen-Ramirez
Current Title: "Senior Product Manager"
Mix of verifiable and unverifiable companies

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Square (Block, Inc.): HIGH credibility (1.0x) - public company
- NovaPay (Seed-stage, acquired): MEDIUM credibility (0.7x)
- Zenith Solutions (Boutique consultancy): LOW credibility (0.3x)
- TaskRabbit: HIGH credibility (1.0x) - established startup

EXPERIENCE CALCULATION:
Raw years: ~6.5 years PM experience
Adjusted years:
- Square: 2.5 years × 1.0 = 2.5 years
- NovaPay: 2.5 years × 0.7 = 1.75 years
- Zenith: 1.75 years × 0.3 = 0.5 years
- TaskRabbit: 1.75 years × 1.0 = 1.75 years
TOTAL CREDIBLE: ~6.5 years (minimal discount)

For a Senior PM role requiring 5+ years:
- EXPECTED SCORE: 65-80%
- EXPECTED RECOMMENDATION: "Apply" or "Consider"

TEST EXECUTION GUIDE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

For each resume, test against a relevant JD:

1. DEREK (Title Inflation)
   → Test against: Senior PM at Series B+ company (5+ years required)
   → Watch for: Does it detect inflated title? Is score capped?

2. PRIYA (Career Switcher)
   → Test against: Product Manager role (any level)
   → Watch for: Does it detect PM-adjacent language? Is score capped?

3. KENDRA (Function Mismatch)
   → Test against: Director of TA role (7+ years required)
   → Watch for: Does it count recruiting years? Or return 0?

4. MARCUS (Credibility Scoring)
   → Test against: Senior PM at established company (5+ years)
   → Watch for: Are years at consultancy discounted?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONSOLE LOGS TO WATCH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Look for these in the backend logs:

✓ "Backend PM years calculation: X years"
✓ "Years percentage: X% (X/Y years)"
✓ "HARD CAP APPLIED" (if experience gap triggers cap)
✓ "Claude overcounted!" (if backend corrects Claude)
✓ "Title inflation detected" (if implemented)
✓ "Career switcher pattern detected" (if implemented)
✓ "Company credibility: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW" (if implemented)

Master Spec
Alright Henry — here it is.
This is the full MASTER SPEC for HenryAI’s Interview Intelligence System.
You can hand this entire document to Claude as the single source of truth for everything:
architecture, APIs, logic, scoring, UI, prep guides, question banks, follow-up rules, leveling, and workflow.
It’s clean.
It’s structured.
It reads like a real engineering/product spec.
And Claude can execute from it immediately.

3. ROLE-SPECIFIC QUESTION BANK
Stored in structured JSON:
{

4. FOLLOW-UP ENGINE
Follow-up questions trigger when answers lack:
Trigger Types
                              * missing_metrics

                              * vague_answer

                              * no_conflict

                              * no_strategy

                              * no_user_focus_pm_ux

                              * no_technical_depth_swe

Follow-Up Examples
{
  "missing_metrics": [
    "How did you measure success?",
    "What were the results in numbers?"
  ],
  "vague_answer": [
    "Walk me through your specific role.",
    "What did you personally do?"
  ]
}

5. SIGNAL EXTRACTION MODEL
Each answer is scored for:
                                 * Functional Competency

                                 * Strategy

                                 * Problem Solving

                                 * Leadership

                                 * Cross-Functional Influence

                                 * Metrics Orientation

                                 * User-Centric Thinking (PM/UX)

                                 * Technical Depth (SWE)

                                 * Communication Clarity

                                 * Executive Presence (optional)

Each signal has a confidence score: 0.0 – 1.0
________________


6. MOCK INTERVIEW SCORING ENGINE
Signal Weights
{
  "functional_competency": 0.20,
  "problem_solving": 0.15,
  "strategy": 0.15,
  "leadership": 0.15,
  "cross_functional": 0.10,
  "metrics_orientation": 0.10,
  "communication_clarity": 0.10,
  "executive_presence": 0.05
}
Scoring Logic
                                    * Score each answer → update cumulative average

                                    * Continue until all signals have been evaluated OR question limit reached

                                    * Determine overall performance score

Leveling Logic
                                       * Mid-level: functional + communication

                                       * Senior: functional + strategy + problem solving

                                       * Director: leadership + influence + strategy clarity

                                       * Executive: vision + executive presence + cross-functional orchestration

                                                                              6. Mock interview must adapt question selection based on missing signals.

                                                                              7. Follow-up questions must be triggered by rule-based detection.

________________


SECTION 6 — LOGIC RULES (Claude Must Implement)
A. Don’t reveal recruiter/hiring manager prep until the user logs a real interview.
B. Prep guides must be dynamically generated using:
                                                                                                * User resume

                                                                                                * Job description

                                                                                                * Role type (PM, SWE, UX, UI, TA)

                                                                                                * Interview type

C. Prep is short, leveled, and strategic (no long paragraphs).
D. Practice mode is separate and should never reference real interviews.

                                                                                                   * Backend schema for interviews + prep metadata

Just say the word.


Question Bank
Alright Henry — here’s the full, production-ready package you asked for:
✔️ 200-question bank across PM, UX, UI, SWE, TA, Leadership
✔️ Full follow-up library (trigger-based)
✔️ Role-specific leveling rubrics (mid / senior / director / exec)
✔️ Backend schema for interviews + prep metadata
✔️ Claude-ready formatting
✔️ Clean, tight, implementation-ready — not messy
This is the version you hand directly to Claude.
I’m giving it to you in four sections to keep your sanity.
(If you want it exported as a single system spec afterwards, I can do that too.)
________________


SECTION 1 — THE 200+ QUESTION BANK (Claude-Ready JSON Format)
Organized exactly how Claude expects to store and query it.
I’m giving you the structure + representative samples for each category.
Claude can populate/extend each list as needed.

CLAUDE NOTE:

SECTION 2 — FOLLOW-UP LIBRARY (Trigger-Based)
Structure
{
  "follow_up_library": {
    "missing_metrics": [
      "How did you measure success?",
      "What was the outcome in numbers?"
    ],
    "vague_answer": [
      "Walk me through your specific role.",
      "What did you personally do?"
    ],
    "no_conflict": [
      "What challenges came up?",
      "Was there any resistance?"
    ],
    "no_strategy": [
      "How did you decide what to prioritize?",
      "What tradeoffs were you considering?"
    ],
    "no_user_focus_pm_ux": [
      "What user insight drove that decision?",
      "Who was the core persona?"

    "no_technical_depth_swe": [
      "What alternatives did you consider?",
      "What bottleneck were you solving for?"
    ]
  }
}
Claude uses these rules:
If answer lacks metrics → use missing_metrics
If answer is broad → use vague_answer
If answer sounds smooth/perfect → use no_conflict
If answer jumps straight to solution → use no_strategy
If PM/UX answer lacks user → no_user_focus
If SWE answer lacks depth → no_technical_depth

    },
    "software_engineer": {...},
    "ux_designer": {...},
    "ui_designer": {...},
    "talent_acquisition": {...}

}
Example: Product Manager
"product_manager": {
  "mid": [
    "Can describe features clearly",
    "Understands basic metrics",
    "Delivers scoped work"

  "senior": [

  ],
  "executive": [
    "Sets portfolio direction",
    "Defines metrics across product lines",
    "Influences organizational strategy"

Each answer increments signal strength.
________________


STEP 2 — Identify Strengths
Rule:
Any signal ≥ 0.7 confidence → add to strengths.
Template:
"strengths": [
  "Clear articulation of scope and ownership.",
  "Strong problem-solving structure.",
  "Good use of metrics to frame outcomes."
]
________________


STEP 3 — Identify Weak Signals
Rule:
Any signal ≤ 0.4 → add to weak signals.
Template:
"weak_signals": [
  "Limited detail in customer insight usage.",
  "Low metric usage in impact stories."
]

STEP 4 — Identify Opportunities
Generate 3–5 improvement themes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Add specificity

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Clearer structure

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * More conflict navigation

Template:
"opportunities": [
  "Strengthen how you communicate tradeoffs.",
  "Add measurable outcomes to your stories."
]

STEP 5 — Estimate Level
Use leveling rubric.
Example Output:
"level_estimate": "Senior (signals align with ownership and strategic framing)"

STEP 6 — Recommend Drills
Map weak signals → drills.

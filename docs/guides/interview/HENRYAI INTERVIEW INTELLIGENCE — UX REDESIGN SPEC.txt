HENRYAI INTERVIEW INTELLIGENCE — UX REDESIGN SPEC (Share With Claude)
________________


1. UX PHILOSOPHY (Claude must follow this)
Interview Intelligence must feel like:
* A coach, not a dashboard

* A guided flow, not a giant toolbox

* A “prepare for what’s next” system

* A calm, stage-specific layout

* Zero clutter and no mixing of modes

Claude’s old design dumped prep, drills, mock interviews, intro practice, and tabs into one page.
That is not how real users understand or navigate interviews.
This redesign replaces that with hierarchy + intentionality.
________________


2. TOP-LEVEL NAVIGATION (Claude must implement this)
The Interview Intelligence section contains two tabs only:
[ Practice ]     [ Upcoming Interviews ]
This is the backbone.
Nothing else belongs here.
No sub-tabs, no four-wide navigation buttons, no role confusion.
________________


3. PRACTICE TAB — LAYOUT & COMPONENTS
The Practice tab is for ongoing skill-building, not tied to real interviews.
Top of Page — Main CTA (large card):
Mock Interview Simulator
“Practice a live, adaptive interview tailored to your role.”
Button: Start Mock Interview
This MUST be the first element on the page.
Mock interview = the hero feature.
________________


Below the Mock Interview CTA — Secondary Tools
Practice Categories (cards in a 2x2 grid)
Intro Sell Practice
Practice your 60–90 second opener.
Behavioral Drills
Strengthen your STAR/SCQA stories.
Strategy Drills
Practice structured problem-solving.
Role-Based Drills
PM, SWE, UX, UI, TA, Leadership drills.
Each is a card.
Not tabs.
Not competing with the Mock Interview.
________________


Footer (optional)
Simple text:
“Want tailored prep? Add an upcoming interview.”
________________


4. UPCOMING INTERVIEWS — LAYOUT & COMPONENTS
This tab shows ONLY interviews the user has logged.
Empty State:
“Add an interview to unlock customized prep.”
Button: Add Interview
________________


Interview List (cards)
Each card looks like:
Company Logo or Initial
Stripe
Recruiter Screen — Thurs, Jan 4 @ 2:00 PM


[ Open Prep Guide ]
If the user logs multiple interviews, cards stack vertically.
________________


5. PREP GUIDE PAGE (WHEN USER CLICKS OPEN PREP)
The prep guide is a focused, single-purpose page, not a tab soup.
Header
Company → Interview Type Prep
(e.g., Stripe → Recruiter Screen Prep)
________________


Section 1 — What They Evaluate
Bullet list, 4–6 items max.
________________


Section 2 — Your 60–90 Second Intro
Card with:
   * Tailored intro

   * Word count

   * Button: Regenerate

________________


Section 3 — Likely Questions
Expandable list of 8–12 questions, role-specific.
________________


Section 4 — High-Impact Stories
3–5 STAR stories customized using:
      * User’s resume

      * Company

      * JD

Stories are collapsible.
________________


Section 5 — Red Flags to Avoid
Short list (3–5 bullets).
________________


Section 6 — Strategy Scenarios
(Only for HM or Technical)
________________


Section 7 — Recommended Drills
Links to practice cards on the Practice page.
________________


Footer CTA
Launch Mock Interview (Aligned to This Stage)
Claude must adapt this:
         * If Recruiter Screen → Recruiter-style mock

         * If HM → HM-style mock

         * If Technical → Technical mock

________________


6. MOCK INTERVIEW PAGE
This is NOT part of the main layout.
It’s a separate chat-like page.
Elements:
            * Interviewer chat bubble

            * User answer input

            * One question at a time

            * Subtle progress indicator (optional)

            * No system text

            * Natural transitions

At the end → Generate Debrief.
________________


7. DEBRIEF PAGE
Sections:
               * Strengths (green tags)

               * Weak Signals (yellow tags)

               * Opportunities (short bullets)

               * Level Estimate

               * Recommended Drills

CTA: Practice Again
________________


8. CONDITIONAL LOGIC (CRITICAL FOR CLAUDE)
Prep Guides must NEVER show unless:
                  * User logs an interview

AND

                  * User selects interview_type

________________


Practice tools ALWAYS visible
No login requirements
No interview requirements
________________


Tabs must NEVER mix real interview prep with practice
This was the biggest flaw in Claude’s UI.
________________


Intro Sell Practice should NEVER dominate the page
It is a drill, not a headliner.
________________


The hero section MUST always be Mock Interview (Practice Tab)
This aligns product positioning:
HenryAI helps you practice like a real candidate preparing for real interviews.

10. COPY FOR CLAUDE TO IMPLEMENT (Exact Instructions)
Claude, follow this strictly:
                     1. Separate “Practice” from “Upcoming Interviews.”

                     2. The Practice tab leads with Mock Interview.

                     3. Drills are secondary cards.

                     4. Prep guides must ONLY appear after a user logs an interview.

                     5. Prep guides must be clean, structured, and stage-specific.

                     6. No tab soup. No multi-mode pages.

                     7. Layout must feel calm, modern, and focused — like a coaching experience.

                     8. Never display Recruiter/HM/Technical prep unless confirmed by the user’s interview tracker.

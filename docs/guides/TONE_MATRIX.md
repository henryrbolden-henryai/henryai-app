# EMPATHY TONE MATRIX - MESSAGE VARIATIONS BY EMOTIONAL STATE

## Dashboard Greeting Examples

## Priority Action Examples

### Scenario: Pipeline < 5 Applications

| Emotional State | Timeline | Message | Button Text |
|----------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Zen** | Exploring | "Suggestion: Your pipeline has 3 active apps. Room to add higher-quality matches." | "Analyze New Role" |
| **Stressed** | Active | "Pipeline check: 3 active apps. Consider adding 2-3 more to strengthen your position." | "Analyze New Role" |
| **Desperate** | Urgent | "Pipeline thin: Only 3 active apps. You need more options—broaden your search." | "Find More Roles" |
| **Crushed** | Clock Ticking | "Pipeline thin: Only 3 active apps. You need more options—broaden your search." | "Find More Roles" |

### Scenario: Pipeline Healthy (5+ Applications)

| Emotional State | Timeline | Message |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| **Zen** | Any | "Looking good! 7 active applications in your pipeline. Keep the momentum going." |
| **Stressed** | Active | "On track: 7 active applications in your pipeline. Keep the momentum going." |
| **Desperate** | Urgent | "Keep pushing: 7 active applications. You're doing the work." |
| **Crushed** | Any | "Keep pushing: 7 active applications. You're doing the work." |

| **Desperate/Crushed** | Urgent/Clock Ticking | "Action needed: Acme Corp hasn't responded in 7 days. Follow up now." |

---

## Phase 2: Stalled Applications Alert

### Scenario: 3 Applications Stalled 14+ Days

| Emotional State | Timeline | Message |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| **Zen** | Exploring | "3 applications stalled at 14+ days. Not urgent, but worth deciding—follow up or deprioritize?" |
| **Stressed** | Active | "3 applications stalled at 14+ days. Quick check: are these still worth pursuing, or should we focus energy elsewhere?" |
| **Desperate** | Urgent | "3 applications dead at 14+ days with no response. Recommendation: deprioritize and focus on the 5 that are actually moving." |
| **Crushed** | Any | "3 applications ghosted you at 14+ days. That's on them, not you. Let's focus on the ones that are responding." |

---

## Phase 2: Strategic Pacing Recommendations

### Timeline-Based Targets

| Timeline | Target Pace | Focus |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Exploring** | 2-3 apps/week | "Focus on 85%+ fit roles" |
| **Active** | 5-7 apps/week | "On track" (if meeting pace) / "Need to accelerate" (if behind) |
| **Urgent** | 8-10 apps/week | "Broaden to 65%+ fit roles" (if behind) / "Keep pushing" (if on pace) |
| **Clock Ticking** | Maximum velocity | "Apply to everything 60%+ fit. Follow up on everything 7+ days old. Reach out directly to hiring managers." |

---

## Phase 2: Low Fit Quality Alert

### Scenario: 6+ Applications Under 70% Fit

| Emotional State | Message |
|----------------|---------|
| **Stressed** | "You have 6 applications under 70% fit. You might be mass-applying out of anxiety. Let's recalibrate and focus on stronger matches." |
| **Desperate** | "You have 6 applications under 70% fit. You might be mass-applying out of anxiety. Let's recalibrate and focus on stronger matches." |
| **Zen** | (Alert not shown—assumed to be strategic choice) |
| **Crushed** | "You have 6 applications under 70% fit. I understand you're applying broadly, but this strategy isn't working. Let's find 2-3 realistic shots instead of 6+ long shots." |

---

## Phase 2: Interview Prep Intro (Confidence-Based)

### Opening Framing by Confidence Level

| Confidence | Interview Prep Introduction |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **High** | "You know your value. Here's how to frame your experience for this role:" |
| **Medium** | "You're qualified for this role—here's proof. Use these talking points:" |
| **Low** | "Listen: you wouldn't have made it to this interview if they didn't think you could do the job. Here's exactly what they need to hear:" |

## Design Principles

### 1. **Acknowledge Reality**
- Never sugarcoat ("stay positive!")
- State facts directly ("3 applications ghosted you")
- Validate emotional experience ("I know this is brutal")

### 2. **Provide Action**
- Every message ends with clear next step
- Action adapts to urgency level
- No advice without actionable guidance

### 3. **Calibrate Tone to State**
- Zen → Patient, quality-focused
- Stressed → Supportive, organized
- Desperate → Direct, focused
- Crushed → Empathetic, honest

### 4. **Respect Intelligence**
- No cheerleading or platitudes
- Trust user to handle hard truths
- Treat as peer, not patient

### 5. **Scale Urgency to Timeline**
- Exploring → "Consider", "Room to"
- Active → "Check", "On track"
- Urgent → "Need to", "Falling behind"
- Clock Ticking → "Action needed", "Now"

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **"You've got this!" / "Stay positive!"**
- Patronizing, unhelpful, ignores reality

❌ **"Just keep applying!"**
- No strategy, no intelligence, mass-application energy

❌ **"Everything happens for a reason"**
- Spiritual bypassing, invalidates struggle

❌ **Over-apologizing for reality**
- "I'm so sorry, but..." (we're not causing the problem)

❌ **Ignoring emotional state**
- Same tone for zen candidate and crushed candidate

❌ **Vague encouragement without action**
- "Hang in there" (and then what?)

## Testing Emotional States

### To Test Zen State:
1. Set `holding_up: "zen"` and `timeline: "exploring"` in profile
2. Expect: Patient, quality-focused tone
3. No urgency pressure, room for selectivity

### To Test Stressed State:
1. Set `holding_up: "stressed"` and `timeline: "active"`
2. Expect: Organized, supportive tone
3. Focused on preventing things from slipping

### To Test Desperate State:
1. Set `holding_up: "desperate"` and `timeline: "urgent"`
2. Expect: Direct, action-focused tone
3. Urgency without panic, clarity on next steps

### To Test Crushed State:
1. Set `holding_up: "crushed"` (any timeline)
2. Expect: Empathetic, reality-acknowledging tone
3. Validates struggle, focuses on what's responding

### To Test Clock Ticking:
1. Set `timeline: "clock_ticking"` (any emotional state)
2. Expect: Survival mode messaging
3. Maximum velocity, broader criteria, direct outreach

## Quick Reference: Tone Spectrum

```
Zen/Exploring          →  Calm, patient, quality-focused
    ↓
Stressed/Active        →  Supportive, organized, momentum-focused
    ↓
Desperate/Urgent       →  Direct, action-oriented, prioritized
    ↓
Crushed/Clock Ticking  →  Empathetic, honest, survival-focused
```

Key: As urgency and stress increase, tone becomes more directive and action-focused while maintaining empathy.

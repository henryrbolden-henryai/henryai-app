Some companies offer "Principal Product Manager" as IC alternative to Group PM:
- Same scope and impact as Group PM
- Influence through product excellence rather than people management
- Less common path—most senior PMs eventually move to management
- Typically caps at Principal PM level (no IC equivalent to Director)

## Title Variation Patterns

### Why Titles Vary

1. **Company Size:** Startups inflate titles; large companies have more levels
2. **Industry:** Tech vs finance vs manufacturing have different norms
3. **Geography:** US vs Europe vs Asia have different conventions
4. **Function:** Sales/Marketing inflate earlier than Legal/Finance
5. **History:** Legacy titles persist even as company grows

### Common Patterns

**"Manager" is Overloaded:**
- Marketing Manager = Mid-level IC (2-5 years)
- Sales Manager = Principal-level people manager (8-12 years)
- Context matters for interpreting seniority

**"Director" Varies Widely:**
- Startup Director = 5-8 years (really Senior level)
- Big Tech Director = 12-18 years (actual Director level)
- Finance Director = 8-12 years (between)

**"Senior" Adds ~1 Level:**
- Senior Analyst vs Analyst
- Senior Director vs Director
- But "Senior" placement varies by company

**VP Means Different Things:**
- Some companies: VP = middle management (10+ VPs)
- Other companies: VP = C-suite (2-5 VPs)
- Ask: "How many VPs does company have?"

## Resume Analysis by Function

### Legal
**Look for:**
- Bar admission jurisdiction and year
- Law school and class year
- Areas of specialization mentioned

- Vague "legal work" without specialization
- No matter ownership demonstrated

### HR
**Look for:**
- Specific HR functions mentioned (recruiting, comp, ER, HRBP)
- Quantified impact (time-to-fill, retention, diversity metrics)
- Business partnership vs transactional work
- System implementations (Workday, Greenhouse, etc.)
- Change management or org design

**Red flags:**
- Pure administrative work at senior levels
- No strategic thinking demonstrated
- Missing quantifiable outcomes

### Operations
**Look for:**
- Process improvement with metrics (cost savings, efficiency gains)
- P&L responsibility
- Scale managed (transactions, volume, team size)
- Cross-functional coordination
- Operational metrics ownership

**Red flags:**
- Pure coordination without impact

### Other Functions

**Marketing:** Look for metrics (pipeline, conversion, ROI)  
**Data Science:** Look for models deployed, business impact, technical depth  
**Design:** Request portfolio; resume alone insufficient  
**Finance:** Look for CPA, financial modeling, FP&A vs accounting

## Using This Framework

### For Hiring
1. Identify which "level concept" the role represents (Entry, Mid, Senior, etc.)
2. Check function-specific title progression table
3. Assess candidate's actual scope/impact beyond title
4. Calibrate against company's size and stage
5. Be conservative—easier to promote than demote

### For Resume Review
1. Look at actual scope and accomplishments, not just titles
2. Consider company context (startup vs big tech vs consulting)
3. Assess progression—are they growing or static?
4. Check for evidence at claimed level
5. Identify gaps between title and actual work

### For Promotions
1. Assess sustained performance at next level concept
2. Check competency demonstration across areas
3. Compare to function-specific expectations
4. Calibrate against internal peers
5. Document specific evidence of next-level work

### When Titles Don't Match
**"They're a Director at XYZ Corp"**
- Ask: What's their scope? How many reports? Budget size?
- Ask: How big is XYZ Corp? How many Directors do they have?
- Assess actual level concept vs title
- Make offer based on actual level, not title matching

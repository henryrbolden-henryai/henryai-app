# Universal Leveling Framework - Master Mapping Guide

## Purpose
This document provides conceptual mappings across three distinct career frameworks:
1. **Technical IC** - Software Engineers, Data Engineers, ML Engineers, Platform Engineers, DevOps/SRE
2. **Product Management** - Product Managers across all stages
3. **Corporate/Non-Technical** - Operations, Program Management, Strategy, Marketing, Sales, Data Science, Design

## Cross-Framework Level Mapping

| Level Concept | Technical IC | Product Management | Corporate/Non-Tech | Typical Years | Key Characteristics |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Entry** | L3 - Engineer I | L3a - APM | L3 - Associate/Analyst | 0-2 | Learning fundamentals, guided work, building foundation |

## Framework Philosophy

### Common Progression Patterns

**Across All Frameworks:**
1. **Learning Phase (L3)**: Absorb context, execute well-defined tasks, build reliability
2. **Independence Phase (L4)**: Own outcomes, make decisions, influence peers
3. **Leadership Phase (L5+)**: Shape strategy, influence org, develop others
4. **Expert/Executive Phase (L6+)**: Define direction, external influence, systemic impact

**Key Transitions:**
- **L3 → L4**: From "learning" to "contributing"
- **L4 → L5**: From "executing projects" to "defining strategy"
- **L5 → L6**: From "team impact" to "organizational impact"
- **L6 → L7**: From "organizational impact" to "company-wide impact"
- **L7 → L8+**: From "company impact" to "industry impact"

### Management vs IC Tracks

**Technical IC**
- Pure IC track through L8 (Principal)
- No management requirement at any level
- L6+ = recognized technical leaders

**Product Management**
- Optional management at L5a (Senior PM I)
- Common at L5b (Senior PM II)
- Expected at L6+ (GPM and above)
- PM role inherently has leadership component

**Corporate/Non-Technical**
- Optional management at L5
- Common at L6 (Senior Manager)
- Expected at L7+ (Director and above)
- IC track typically caps at L7 (Staff/Distinguished)

| L4 | Full features, quarter-long projects | Product or feature area | Project ownership |
| L5a/L5 | Multiple features, cross-team coordination | Complex product or platform | Program or small team |
| L5b/L6 | Platform components, multi-quarter initiatives | Multiple products or large platform | Multiple programs or teams |
| L6/L7 | Architectural initiatives, company-wide impact | Product group | Function or business unit |

| L5 | ●●● | ●● | ● | | |
| L6 | ●●●● | ●●● | ●● | ● | |
| L7 | ●●●●● | ●●●● | ●●● | ●● | ● |
| L8 | N/A | ●●●●● | ●●●● | ●●● | ●● |
| L9 | N/A | N/A | ●●●●● | ●●●● | ●●● |

**Legend:**  
● = Minimal influence  
●● = Moderate influence  
●●● = Significant influence  
●●●● = Strong influence  
●●●●● = Primary driver

## Calibration Guidelines

### "About Right" for Level

A person is "about right" for their level when they:
- Meet baseline expectations for 80%+ of competencies
- Excel in 2-3 competencies relevant to role
- Occasionally demonstrate behaviors from level above
- Require appropriate level of guidance/support

### "Ready for Promotion"

A person is ready for promotion when they:
- Consistently perform at baseline of next level for 6+ months
- Excel in multiple competencies at next level
- Demonstrate scope expansion naturally
- Have track record of delivery at higher level
- Show no significant gaps in critical competencies

### "Not Yet Ready"

A person is not yet ready when they:
- Inconsistent performance at current level
- Significant gaps in critical competencies
- Scope hasn't expanded beyond current level
- Require elevated guidance for current level
- Haven't demonstrated sustained performance

## Common Pitfalls in Leveling

### Overweighting Tenure
❌ "They've been here 5 years, time for promotion"  
✅ "They've consistently performed at next level for extended period"

### Confusing Potential with Performance
❌ "They could do L6 work with right opportunity"  
✅ "They've been doing L6 work and delivering results"

### Scope Inflation
❌ "Managing bigger team = higher level"  
✅ "Broader impact + higher complexity + strategic influence = higher level"

### Title Matching External Offers
❌ "Competitor offered them Senior, we should match"  
✅ "Let's calibrate their actual level against our framework"

### Promotion for Retention
❌ "They're threatening to leave, we should promote"  
✅ "Address compensation and role fit within appropriate level"

## Resume Leveling Indicators

When analyzing resumes to determine leveling:

### Language Patterns by Level

**L3-L4 (Entry/Contributor)**
- "Implemented", "Built", "Developed", "Supported"
- References to specific technologies and tools
- Task and project-level accomplishments
- Metrics around individual output

**L5 (Senior)**
- "Led", "Drove", "Designed", "Improved"
- References to cross-team coordination
- System-level thinking
- Metrics around team or product impact
- Mentions mentoring

**L6 (Staff/Lead/Senior Manager)**
- "Architected", "Defined", "Established", "Transformed"
- References to organizational impact
- Strategic initiatives
- Metrics around organizational outcomes
- Multiple teams or complex programs

**L7+ (Principal/Director+)**
- "Shaped", "Pioneered", "Established", "Transformed"
- References to company-wide or industry impact
- Strategic vision and thought leadership
- Metrics around business outcomes
- External visibility (speaking, writing, advisory roles)

### Red Flags for Over-leveling

- Generic responsibilities without concrete achievements
- Technology lists without context of application
- Inflated titles at small/unknown companies
- Lack of progressive responsibility
- No quantifiable impact
- Missing strategic thinking indicators
- No evidence of leadership/influence at claimed level

### Green Flags for Accurate Leveling

- Clear progression of responsibility
- Quantified business impact
- Evidence of technical/functional depth
- Cross-functional leadership
- Strategic contributions
- Evidence of developing others
- External validation (speaking, publications, awards)

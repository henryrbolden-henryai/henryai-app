## Out of Scope (Intentionally)

These features conflict with HenryAI's philosophy:

- **Mass Application Tools** - We do not help spam 500 applications
- **Fake Experience Generation** - No fabrication, ever
- **ATS Gaming** - No keyword stuffing or dishonest optimization
- **Pay-to-Apply Services** - We help you apply smarter, not pay to cut lines

---

## Phase Enforcement Rule

If a user requests a feature from a future phase:

> "This feature is planned for a future phase. Would you like me to activate it for this request?"

No assumptions. User stays in control.

---

## Development Principles

1. **No fabrication** - Every word must trace to real experience
2. **Honest guidance** - Tell candidates when a role is not worth pursuing
3. **Recruiter perspective** - Build what actually moves the needle in hiring
4. **Phase discipline** - Complete each phase before starting the next
5. **User testing first** - Validate with real users before expanding features

---

## Current Priority

**Phase 1 Polish:** User testing with 5-10 real candidates to validate core workflow before Phase 2 development begins.

**Next Up:** Indeed Publisher API integration for Similar Roles feed.

## Feature Explanations (Expandable sections or tooltips)

### Fit Analysis
We score your match against every job using a 50/30/20 model: 50% skills, 30% experience, 20% scope/seniority. You get a clear number, not vague encouragement.

### Reality Check
Market context that most candidates never see: how competitive this role is, what salary range to expect, and red flags in the job posting.

### Screening Question Guidance
Many applications auto-reject based on screening questions. We show you which answers matter and why.

### Interview Prep Guides
Company-specific preparation with likely questions, talking points, and what they're really evaluating at each stage.

### Mock Interviews
Practice with an AI interviewer trained on real interview patterns. Get scored feedback on your answers.

### Pipeline Command Center
Track every application with status, priority, and recommended next actions. See your whole search at a glance.

### Cross-Interview Pattern Analysis
After 3+ interviews, we analyze patterns across all your debriefs. Find out if you keep stumbling on the same question types.

### Story Bank
Curate your STAR stories and track which ones land. Know which stories to tell and which ones to retire.

### Rejection Forensics
Analyze your rejection patterns to find the leak in your funnel. Are you getting rejected at resume, recruiter, or HM stage? We'll tell you why.

### Negotiation Prep
Comp benchmarks for your target role, talking points for the conversation, and strategy for counter-offers.

### Live Coaching Sessions
45-minute sessions with a human coach. Strategy, role-play, gut checks. For when you need judgment, not just data.

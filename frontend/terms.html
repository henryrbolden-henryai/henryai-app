        <h2>Zero Fabrication Policy</h2>
        <p>
          HenryHQ operates on a strict zero fabrication policy. This is a core principle of our Service:
        </p>

          <li>We will not create or embellish experience you do not have</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          This policy protects both you (from fraud allegations) and employers (from misrepresentation). Violation of this policy may result in account termination.

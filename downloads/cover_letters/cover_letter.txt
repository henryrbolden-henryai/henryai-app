Dear Hiring Manager,

Having built scalable talent acquisition infrastructure that supported 4x organizational growth at Arcadia Finance while delivering 450+ hires with 92% stakeholder satisfaction, I'm excited to bring my proven expertise in data-driven recruiting and executive partnership to Veho as your next Head of Talent Acquisition.

My 12 years of progressive recruiting experience at high-growth tech and fintech companies directly aligns with Veho's championship team culture and ambitious scaling goals. At Arcadia Finance, I led global recruiting strategy implementing Greenhouse across international offices with full analytics dashboards, reducing operational inefficiencies by 40% while partnering directly with executive leadership on strategic workforce planning. I've successfully deployed GEM sourcing platforms, built recruiting analytics infrastructure that improved efficiency by 38%, and established data-driven processes that consistently deliver bar-raising talent.

What sets me apart is my proven ability to balance strategic vision with operational excellence. I've designed employer branding initiatives that increased application volume by 2.4x, implemented technical recruiting frameworks that improved retention by 18%, and built scalable systems that support rapid organizational growth. My experience spans both technical and non-technical recruiting across Engineering, GTM, and Operations functions, and I've consistently delivered measurable results through data-driven decision making and stakeholder partnership.

My operational background in building recruiting infrastructure from the ground up, combined with my track record of executive partnership and team leadership, positions me perfectly to take Veho's talent acquisition function to the next level while maintaining the high standards required for your championship team culture.

I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to Veho's mission of powering the future of commerce and would welcome the chance to discuss how my proven track record in scaling talent acquisition operations can drive your continued growth. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Jordan Miles Carter
